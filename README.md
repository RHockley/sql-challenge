# sql-challenge
This repository contains the files for week 9 homework regarding SQL.

The purpose was to obtain information from 6 separate csv files containing employee data from Pewlett Hackard.

Using PgAdmin, tables were created and the data from the csv files were imported.

SQL queries were constructed to get the information requested.

I was quite sick during this week hence why this README is lacking in substance...sorry.

Robbie.
